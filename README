This Rack middleware (external-uri-loader.rb) stands on its own.
It is intended to serve an external Web resource as though it were local,
allowing further transmogrification.

techiferous's rack-plastic (http://github.com/techiferous/rack-plastic)
is a complementary, foundation middleware for
easily performing subsequent Nokogiri manipulation of the page to be rendered.
