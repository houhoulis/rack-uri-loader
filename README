This Rack middleware (external-uri-loader.rb) stands on its own.
It is intended to serve an external Web resource as though it were local,
allowing further transmogrification.

If you set your rails app to serve a view as text rather than as html,

  render :text => "http://ebay.com", :content_type => "text/plain"

then this middleware assumes you are giving it a URL.  The middleware fetches
the URL and serves up the resource in the context of your application (rather
than redirecting you to that URL).

(techiferous's rack-plastic, http://github.com/techiferous/rack-plastic,
is a complementary middleware which you could use to facilitate further
Nokogiri manipulation of the page to be rendered.  It was part of the
inspiration for this middleware.)
