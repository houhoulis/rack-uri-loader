<h1>
Is your computer not behaving the way you'd like?
</h1>

<div class="point">
Are you having trouble with your printer, internet connection, or wireless network?
</div>
<div class="point">
Are you experiencing lost or "corrupted" documents, or computer crashes?
</div>
<div class="point">
Do you feel using email, the Web, office productivity software, digital photographs, CD/DVD burning, etc. is more stressful than it should be?
</div>
<div class="point">
Are you looking for advice or assistance regarding computer security tools (firewalls, anti-virus, anti-spyware and -malware, etc.), or about using the Web safely?
</div>
<div class="point">

<p>
I am interested in hearing your story and returning your computer(s) to smooth and snappy functioning. &ensp; I have experience helping people with all of the above, up to and including:</p>

<div class="point2">
recovering corrupted documents;
</div>
<div class="point2">
cleaning up computers that are sluggish, start up slowly, or show signs of infection -- such as unusual popups, or interference with use of the internet;
</div>
<div class="point2">
improving security settings;
</div>
<div class="point2">
installing new software, and making sure critical software stays updated;
</div>
<div class="point2">
recovering from failed hard drives; and
</div>
<div class="point2">
implementing backup technology to safeguard personal data, such as digital photos.
</div>
<div id="p3">
<p>
I'll investigate the issues that you are experiencing, and provide as much education as you would like (in easy-to-understand language!) &ensp; Then I'll fix the problems -- or help you fix them yourself.&ensp; I can provide written documentation of the repairs so that, if you prefer, you are NOT LOCKED IN to calling me if problems crop up in the future.&ensp; I will visit your home or office in the metro Boston area.&ensp; I'm available business hours as well as some evenings and weekends.
</p> <p>
Besides my work with Mass. Computer Relief, I am a part-time social work student, part-time human services worker, a former math tutor, and a former computer programmer.
